# Another-Hello
Doing this again

My favorite color is dark aqua, a deep blue interwoven with veins of green. You can find this color in the ocean if you go down far enough. I might actually be a dolphin, or a mermaid.

This is another paragraph about colors. I might have to change my opinion on the most favorite of colors as it is winter and I long for sunshine. Not this weak cloud-filtered sunlight that glitters on my snow covered backyard, but full on glow that bakes the ground and grows the grass. So, gold might be the color I am favoring today ... 

Practice makes progress. Not perfect, mind you, but progress.
