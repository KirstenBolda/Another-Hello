# Another-Hello
Doing this again

My favorite color is dark aqua, a deep blue with veins of green. You can find this color in the ocean if you go down far enough. I might actually be a dolphin, or a mermaid.

Because I'm intrigued by how this works.

And practice makes progress. Not perfect, mind you, but progress.
